  * Bugfix: accept mbuffer command (stream_compress) in
    ssh_filter_btrbk.sh

btrbk-0.25.1

  * Support for btrfs-progs v4.12: fix parsing of "btrfs sub show"
    output, which now prints relative paths (close #171).

    and "lockfile" configuration options.
  * Show "up-to-date" status for backups in "stats" command.
  * Show "correlated" status instead of "orphaned" in "stats" command.
  * Check source subvolumes for readonly and received_uuid flags, and
    abort if one of them is set.

btrbk-0.25.0

  * MIGRATION
    - If you call ssh_filter_btrbk.sh with "--sudo" option, make sure
      to set "backend btrfs-progs-sudo" in btrbk.conf for this host.
    - If "rate_limit" is enabled, update ssh_filter_btrbk.sh on remote
      source hosts, and make sure the "pv" command is available there.
  * Allow converting backup disks to source disks (close #114).
  * Add "backend btrfs-progs-sudo" configuration option (close #115).

    prevents creation of "~/.gnupg/random_seed" with slight perfomance
    penalty.

btrbk-0.24.0

  * MIGRATION
    - update ssh_filter_btrbk.sh on remote hosts if "stream_compress"
      is enabled. Also add "--compress" option to ssh_filter_btrbk.sh
      invocation if "stream_compress" is enabled.
  * Add "stream_compress" configuration option.
  * Perform extra metadata check on target subvolume after "btrfs
    receive" (adds an additional call to "btrfs subvolume show").

    option (close: #81).

  * INCOMPATIBLE CONFIGURATION:
    * Please read "doc/upgrade_to_v0.23.0.md" for details on updating
      the configuration file (/etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf).
    * Dropped "btrfs_progs_compat" option. Need btrfs-progs >= v3.18.
    * Removed "resume_missing" configuration option.
  * Create backups only if needed to satisfy retention policy.
  * Preserve FIRST backup of hour/day/week/month instead of LAST.
  * Replaced "{snapshot,target}_preserve_{daily,weekly,monthly}"
    configuration options with "{snapshot,target}_preserve_min" and
    "{snapshot,target}_preserve NNh NNd NNw NNm NNy" options.
  * Added hourly/yearly retention policies (close: #36, #69).
  * Allow regular directories for send-receive targets (close: #77).
  * Allow wildcards in subvolume section (close: #71).
  * Propagate targets defined in "volume" or "root" context to all
    "subvolume" sections (close: #78).
  * Added "archive" command (close: #79).

  * Warn on receive targets at unexpected location (instead of abort).
  * On incremental send/receive, use all snapshots sharing same
    parent_uuid as candidates for "-p <parent>" instead of only older
    snapshots. As last resort, use subvolumes in snapshot_dir matching
    btrbk file name scheme as candidates (which allows incremental
    backups after the parent vanished, e.g. after backup restore).
  * Use perl built-in Time::Local instead of Date::Calc.
  * Improvements of internal data structures.
